               The Wolfpack

               A wolfpack is a group of wolves. A wolf has a name and an age. The leader of the wolfpack is the oldest wolf. All wolves are submissive to older wolves and dominant over younger wolves.

               A wolf can join a pack. If a wolf joins a pack and becomes leader, the pack throws out the former leader.

               A wolf can howl. It howls louder if it's older than 3 than if it's younger. If you call out the name of a wolf to its pack, that wolf will howl.

               A wolfpack can take down different sized things depending on how big it is.

               A pack of 2 wolves can hunt a gazelle.
               A pack of 5 wolves can get a water buffalo.
               A pack of 30 wolves can eat a rhinoceros.
               I used a lot of synonyms there in the hunting section. You don't need methods for all of them.

               example method uses:

               old_wolf.submissive_to?(young_wolf) #=> false
               old_wolf.dominant_over?(young_wolf) #=> true
               pack_of_2_wolves.can_hunt?(:gazelle)   #=> true
               pack_of_10_wolves.can_hunt?(:gazelle) #=> true

               wolf.howl #=> 'howwwwl'
